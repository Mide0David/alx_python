# Python Hello World

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts that cover various programming tasks. Each script is located in a separate file within the `python-hello_world` directory.

## Task 0: Hello, print

**File**: `0-print.py`

This script prints the following message:

```
Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
```

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python3 0-print.py
```

## Task 1: Copy - Cut - Paste

**File**: `1-edges.py`

This script performs the following actions:

- It defines a variable `word` and assigns it a string value.
- It extracts the first 3 letters of the variable `word` and assigns them to the variable `word_first_3`.
- It extracts the last 2 letters of the variable `word` and assigns them to the variable `word_last_2`.
- It extracts the middle part of the variable `word` (excluding the first and last letters) and assigns it to the variable `middle_word`.
- Finally, it prints the values of `word_first_3`, `word_last_2`, and `middle_word` using the `print` function.

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python3 1-edges.py
```

## Task 2: Positive anything is better than negative nothing

**File**: `2-positive_or_negative.py`

This script assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. The script determines whether the number is positive, negative, or zero and prints the corresponding message.

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python3 2-positive_or_negative.py
```

## Task 3: The last digit

**File**: `3-last_digit.py`

This script assigns a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed. The script prints the last digit of the number and provides additional information based on the value of the last digit.

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python3 3-last_digit.py
```

## Task 4: Hexadecimal printing

**File**: `4-print_hexa.py`

This script prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal formats. It uses a loop and a single print statement to achieve this.

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python3 4-print_hexa.py
```

## Task 5: 00...99

**File**: `5-print_comb2.py`

This script prints numbers from 0 to 99. The numbers are separated by a comma and a space, and the last number is followed by a new line.

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python3 5-print_comb2.py
```

## Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials

**File**: `6-print_comb3.py`

This script prints all possible different combinations of two digits. The digits are separated by a comma and a space, and the last combination is followed by a new line. The combinations are printed in ascending order.

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python3 6-print_comb3.py
```

Feel free to explore each script and execute them to see the desired outputs. Enjoy coding!
